Task Tree Application
Most task applications are just checking off single items, or they have sub-steps that you can create and mark. However, many real-life tasks are often blocking: you need to figure out a time to meet with someone, and you sent them an email about it, so you "finished" the item, but you need to wait for their response and make sure it actually works before that item is fully finished. This is something traditional task applications do poorly. Task Tree features task trees, where you can make a chain of tasks (tasks that lead to the next where each can be marked as blocking or some other denotation that it's externally dependent), normal individual tasks, and so on. Tasks can lead to multiple dependent tasks, and tasks can then be dependent on multiple tasks.
